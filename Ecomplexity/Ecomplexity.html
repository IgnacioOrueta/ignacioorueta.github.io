        About the project  
      </p> <br>


      <p class="title is-5">
          The aim of this project is to highlight the importance of Economic Complexity and its connection to economic growth and development. 
          I also look into a successful example of increasing economic complexity, and extract valuable lessons that other countries can learn.

          Data        
      </p>

      <p class="title is-5">
        The data used for this project comes from 3 sources: <br><br>
        1) <a href="https://comtradeplus.un.org/" target="_blank">COMTRADE</a>: This source aggregates detailed global annual and monthly trade statistics 
        by product and trading partner. It covers approximately 200 countries and represents more than 99% of the world's merchandise trade. 
        It also has an API developer tool, which I integrated to my workflow. 
        <br><br>
        2) <a href="https://atlas.hks.harvard.edu/data-downloads" target="_blank">Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity</a>: Using COMTRADE data,
        this website provides information about the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), Economic Complexity Rankings, and the Product Complexity Index (PCI).
        <br><br>
        3) <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank</a>: This source offers data on various health, inequality, and environmental outcomes.
        These datasets were analyzed with the previously mentioned data.

        Analytical challenges        
    </p> <br>

    <p class="title is-5">
      The biggest challenges in this project were the following: <br><br>
      1) Data integration: 
      Combining data from multiple sources was complex due to missing data and differences in data formats, codes and time periods available.
      To address this, I needed to preprocess data to create a merged and unified dataset. 
      <br><br>
      2) Visualization of high-dimensional data:  
      Since I had several dimensions to show (complexity rankings, products, years, population, etc) in different aggregation levels, 
      I used advanced visualization techniques such as bubble charts, interactive dashboards and tooltips to represent multidimensional data clearly.
      <br><br>
      3) Communicating findings: 
      Explaining complex relations in a few words is always difficult. 
      For this, I tried to simplify my findings as much as possible, only highlighting the most important insights and using intuitive visualizations.

      <h1 class="title is-1">What is Economic Complexity? How it's measured?</h1> <br>

        
        <p class="title is-5">
          The Economic Complexity Index (ECI) measures the level of knowledge in a society as expressed in the products it makes <a href="https://atlas.hks.harvard.edu/glossary" target="_blank">(Harvard Atlas, 2022)</a>.            
          In simple terms, it measures the country's <b>diversification</b> (i.e the variety of products a country is able to make) and <b>ubiquity</b> (i.e. the number of countries capable of producing a given product.) of their exports. 
          <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cg/doi/10.1073/pnas.0900943106" target="_blank">(Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009)</a>. 
        </p>

        <p class="title is-5">
          Thus, a countryâ€™s total diversity and ubiquity is a way of expressing the amount of collective know-how held within that country, and the complexity of its knowledge.
        </p>
        <p class="title is-5">
          <a href="https://www.pnas.org/cg/doi/10.1073/pnas.0900943106" target="_blank">Hidalgo & Hausmann (2009)</a> showed that complexity is correlated with a country's level of income, 
          and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. Thus, development strategies should aim to create conditions that foster the emergence of complexity, leading to sustained growth and prosperity.

                <p class="title is-5">
                  Economic Complexity vary tremendously across countries.
                  However, despite diversity, there are some regional patterns. For example, the USA and European countries consistently have high scores
                  By contrast, African countries tend to be in the lower section of the ranking, showing a lag in economic complexity. 
                  <br><br>
                  In the other hand, some Asian countries have a notable increase in the ranking from 1995 to 2022. Some examples of this are China, Taiwan and Vietnam.  
                  This shows that some countries diversified their exports substantially more than others, further enhancing economic complexity.

                showed that complexity is correlated with income.
                This indicates that wealthier countries tend to have more complex economies, and vice versa. 
                <br> <br>
                While causality is not obvious, this indicates that development efforts should focus on generating 
                the conditions for complexity to generate.

              <p class="title is-5"> 
                Complexity is also related to other non-economic measures, such as health outcomes.

                showed robust evidence that countries exporting complex products, on average, enjoy better health outcomes.
                <br><br>
                The key channel through which ECI transmits to health improvements is via strengthening employment opportunities. 
                Thus, health improvements can be promoted through structural transformation toward producing more sophisticated products.

                showed that this relationship is conditional on other factors, such as education, government and trade openness.
                This means that, when these factors reach certain thresholds, the benefits of higher economic complexity in reducing income inequality are higher.

                  <p class="title is-5">

                    To understand what complexity looks like in practice, it's helpful to examine the export matrix of the top and bottom five countries in terms of complexity.
                    <br><br>
                    First, the most complex countries exhibit a diversified export matrix, with products that are relatively more difficult to produce and that fewer countries can elaborate. 
                    This means that these countries have extensive collective knowledge to produce a variety of goods and do not need to rely on a single product for global trade.

                  <p class="title is-5">
                    On the other hand, the least complex countries show a highly concentrated export matrix, mainly focused in raw materials, such as Minerals and Agricultural products which are the least complex products to create.

            <h2 class="title is-2"> IV. The product space network </h2> 
            <br>

              <p class="title is-5">
                  Another key concept in the complexity framework is the level of similarity between products. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1144581" target="_blank">Hidalgo & Hausmann (2007)</a>.
                  The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to create new products are more easily adapted from some products than others. 
                  This is called the level of <b>relatedness</b> between products, which is often visualized as a â€œproduct space" network. 
                  Interestingly, the authors found that countries progress through the product space by developing goods closer to those they currently produce. 
                  Additionally, more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core, while less-sophisticated products are located in a less-connected periphery.             
                  <br><br>
                  Thus, less complex countries can reach the core of the product space only by "jumping" infrequent distances. 
                  This suggests an explanation on why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports 
                  and fail to converge to the income of rich countries.

                  <h3 class="title is-3">A successful case of transition: the last decades of Vietnam     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IgnacioOrueta/ignacioorueta.github.io/main/Project_1/img/vietnam.png" alt="Vietnam Flag" style="width:60px;height:auto;"></h3>

                  <p class="title is-5">
                    Despite the difficulty for less complex countries to produce higher complex products, there are some successful cases of transitioning from less-to-more complex economies. 
                    For example, in 1995, Vietnam was ranked 101st out of 146 countries, while in 2022 achieved the 53rd position, being the country with the biggest increase in the ranking during that period.
                    <br><br>
                    During the last decades, Vietnam's largest contribution to export growth came from Electrical Machinery and Equipment and Industrial Machinery, which are highly complex products. 
                    This reallocation from low to high productivity sectors was driven by promoting foreign companies, such as the South Korea's Samsung, to transfer their production to the country.
                    <a href="https://www.mitsui.com/mgssi/en/report/detail/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2023/09/05/2307h_kawamura_e.pdf

                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, Vietnam has bilateral agreements and comprehensive economic partnership agreements with several countries and regions. 
                    In recent years, through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the EU and the UK, which have stringent decarbonization regulations, Vietnam has been striving to enhance its international competitiveness. 
                    The country is doing this by setting up high-quality domestic production operations that comply with these international standards.                  
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, amidst the rising trade conflict between the US and China, Vietnam took the right steps to position themselves as an alternative destination for exporting goods to the US.

                    As mentioned earlier, the ECI has a strong relationship with GDP per capita. 
                    However, <a href="https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/growth-projections" target="_blank">Hidalgo, et. al, (2009)</a> noted that is also a good predictor for future growth.
                    Analytically, this idea states that, within the same level of GDP per capita, countries with different complexities should have different growth paths.                    
                    Thus, countries that are 'too complex' for their present GDP per capita, should have higher growth in the following years, while countries "too complex" for their GDP per capita levels are expected to slow down their growth.       
                    <br><br>
                    Based on this idea, the <a href="https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/growth-projections" target="_blank">Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity.</a>, estimated growth trends for the next decade, which is what I replicated in the next chart.
                    As you see, highest growths are expected in East Asia and East Africa, especially UGanda (6.7%), Uzbekistan (6.1%) and Vietnam (5.8%).

        <h2 class="title is-2"> Final thoughts</h2> <br>

        <p class="title is-5">

          This project highlights the role of Economic Complexity in economic growth and development. 
          The analysis confirms that countries with higher economic complexity tend to have higher GDP per capita, higher life expectancy, lower inequality and lower CO2 emissions by dollar produced. 
          This suggests that Economic Complexity is a strong indicator of economic prosperity. 
          Therefore, policymakers should focus on strategies to enhance the complexity of their economies, such as investing in education, innovation, and infrastructure.
          <br><br>          
          Additionally, the are significant regional disparities in economic complexity, with developed countries in North America and Europe exhibiting higher complexity. 
          However, there are some successful cases outside the developed world that showed a big improvement in their export matrix, such as Vietnam.
          This demonstrates that increasing Economic Complexity can be addressed by disadvantaged countries by focusing on their advantages and coordinating key areas of their economies.
