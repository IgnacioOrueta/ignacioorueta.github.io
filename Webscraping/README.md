## Project: Retrieving data for a retail market analysis

This is a web scraping project for the course MY472: Data for Data Scientists at LSE.

Here, I retrieve data from Wikipedia, Transport for London, Data for London, Google Maps and Rightmove to elaborate a retail market analysis fo the pharmacy industry in London.

In this folder, you will find the following documents:

1. An Rmd file called "Webscraping.Rmd" that contains the Rmarkdown with all the code crated to elaborate this project. 
2. Data folder: Here you will find all data downloaded through public websites (such as Wikipedia, Transport for London, and Data for London), and the scraped data from Google Maps and Rightmove.
3. Outputs folder: Here you will find all charts that I created to show the results of the project.
