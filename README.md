# Projects

Hi! I am Ignacio, a first-year MPA - Data Science student at LSE. My expertise lies in Data Analysis, Data Science and Economics. In this website, you will find my projects.

I hope you like them.


## Ecomplexity: A comparative analysis of countries' Economic Complexity
This project address the importance of Economic Complexity and its connection to economic growth and development. I also look into a successful example of increasing economic complexity, and extract valuable lessons that other countries can learn.

## Web scraping: Retail market analysis
This is a web scraping project for the course MY472: Data for Data Scientists at LSE.

Here, I retrieve data from Wikipedia, Transport for London, Data for London, Google Maps and Rightmove to elaborate a retail market analysis fo the pharmacy industry in London.

## RL: Optimal interest rate in Central Banking 
_With Krisha Kadnani and Leonardo Luksic._

This project trains a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to compute optimal interest rate reaction functions as a Central Bank. We first use quarterly data from the US Federal Reserve bank to estimate the transition equations of a simulated environment (i.e., inflation and output gap) by specifying linear (OLS) and non-linear (ANN) models. We then train optimal policies with this simulated environment and evaluate the algorithm performance by comparing it the most common benchmark in the literature (i.e., the Taylor rule).
